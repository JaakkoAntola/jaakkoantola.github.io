            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>As a young child, I was surrounded by the soothing melodies of piano keys and the captivating world of video games. With a musical family as my foundation, I began playing the piano when I was just 3 years old. My love for games grew alongside my passion for music, and as I explored the enchanting realms of Hyrule and the deep jungles of Donkey Kong Country, I became fascinated with the soundtracks that accompanied my digital adventures.</p>
            
            <p>At the age of 9, the mesmerizing OSTs from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, as well as Donkey Kong Country, captivated my heart and imagination. These memorable tunes naturally led me to take a keen interest in game music composition, fueling my desire to create my own atmospheric and unforgettable melodies.</p>

            <p>During my time at university, I had the opportunity to delve into the world of game design and music composition. These experiences allowed me to collaborate with fellow creators and expand my skill set, furthering my growth as an artist.</p>

            <blockquote>“I wish to leave something memorable to this world, be it a piece of music, a photograph, or a story.”</blockquote>

            <p>My creative arsenal consists of a variety of tools that help me bring my musical visions to life. I trust in Ableton Live, my reliable Yamaha S90XS, and an array of VSTs and analog synths for composing game music. For capturing the world through my lens, I rely on the DJI Mavic 2 Zoom for breathtaking drone photography and the Canon 6D and Canon M50 Mark II for traditional photography.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond the realm of music and photography, I find solace in life's simple pleasures. A steaming cup of coffee, a quiet fishing trip, or a long walk through nature provides me with the inspiration and energy needed to pursue my creative endeavors. These moments of tranquility offer a chance to reflect and recharge, connecting me with the world around me and fueling my artistic pursuits.</p>
