                    <p>LoL: A unique and experimental piece, LoL was one of my initial forays into using Ableton Live for music production.

Though created primarily as a practice exercise and not fully polished, LoL showcases my willingness to explore new musical ideas and push the boundaries of my creativity.</p>
